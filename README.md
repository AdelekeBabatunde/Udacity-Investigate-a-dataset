##Introduction
### Dataset Description
In this Project, we will be analyzing The Movie database(TMdb) that contains information about 10,000 movies. The columns in the dataset are the following: id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime, genres, production_companies, release_date, vote_count, vote_average, release_year, budget_adj, revenue_adj

## Question(s) for Analysis
Which genres are most popular from year to year?

What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?

Which directors has the highes revenue?

Which Production Company has the highest revenue?

## Conclusions
In conclusion, we can see that the revenue is positively correlated with the budget, popularity and runtime value. We also saw that Comedy and drama have year on year popularity among the genres. We also explored the directors to know if the directors that have highest revenues and also production companies. This insight shows us that production companies also have a correlation with revenue and also the directors

Limitations such as null values didn't allow for extra understanding of the dataset as we needed to drop them since they have low impact this in turn affected our values for revenue. In addition, there were multiple overlapping values in genre which limited our exploration of genre further
